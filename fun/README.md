# Fun Commands
These commands are standalone. Pick and choose which CCs you wish to add.
These commands are all based around fun concepts, i.e quoting messages, text to emoji, etc.

As usual, there is a leading comment showing the trigger and description of the CC.

## Maze
  * [x] ExecCC support

Pretty simple, makes a maze command with an optional arguement of "crossings" if you don't know about crossings,they are part of the maze that make a bridge over another path, see image below. By clicking on "solution" it'll automatically download the png solution.
